# ArrExtensionBlocklist
A simple linkable blocklist for arrs that support URL-based lists.

The list can be input either by copying and pasting or if your application supports URL-based lists, you can use the following URL to correctly pull the raw list:

This method is better because URL-based lists usually update automatically so whenever a new commit is pushed, your list updates as well.
